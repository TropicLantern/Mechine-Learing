What is Machine Learning?
Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
experience E,task T,performance measure P
Example: playing checkers.
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

Supervised learning
right answers given
Regression:Predict continuous(for example,valued output such as "price")
Classification problem
Discrete valued,output(0 or 1......)


Unsupervised learning

Others:Reinforcement learning,recommender systems
